<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 19 or higher
  - A docs repository with a `docs.json` file
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```
</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" alt="Screenshot of a deployment confirmation message that says All checks have passed." style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.

#### Understanding capture groups
Capture groups in your regular expression control how multi-metric panels are created. This behavior can be confusing if you're not expecting it.

- **Capture groups create multiple panels**
    When your regular expression includes parentheses that form a capture group, the UI creates a separate panel for each unique value captured by that group.

    For example, the expression `(layer_0|layer_10)_loss` includes a capture group and will create two separate panels:
    1. One panel for metrics matching `layer_0`.
    2. One panel for metrics matching `layer_10`.

- **Non-capturing groups keep metrics together**
    To match multiple alternatives without creating separate panels, use a non-capturing group with the `?:` syntax. The expression `(?:layer_0|layer_10)_loss` matches the same metrics as the previous example, but displays them together in a single panel.

Here's the difference:
- `(layer_0|layer_10)_loss` - Creates two panels, one for each layer
- `(?:layer_0|layer_10)_loss` - Creates one panel showing both layers together

This gives you flexibility to choose the approach that best fits your analysis needs. Use capture groups when you want to separate metrics into distinct panels. Use non-capturing groups when you want to compare metrics together on a single plot.
